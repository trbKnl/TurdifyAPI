The program has been been written in python and it uses [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi).

## The main program

The main program can be found in `app.py`. From the comments it should be clear what it does. If you want to run the program yourself: check the requirements.txt to see all the dependencies you need to install, and the see `Dockerfile` how you should start the program.

The program is hosted at [turdify.niekdeschipper.com](https://turdify.niekdeschipper.com) and has been written for educational purposes.

The program has a web interface to make it a little more interesting. The webpage has been made with
[Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com). Check out the included folder `./welcomepage` for all the details.
